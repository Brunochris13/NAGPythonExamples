Linear semidefinite programming can be viewed as a generalization of linear programming. While keeping many good properties of LP (such as the duality theory and solvability in polynomial time), SDP introduces a new highly nonlinear type of constraint â€“ matrix inequality. It is an inequality on the eigenvalues of a matrix which depends on the decision variables. Typically, the matrix inequality is written in the form to request all eigenvalues of the matrix to be non-negative, thus the matrix is to be positive semidefinite
