# Examples for Mark 27 of the NAG Library for Python 

Mark 27 of the NAG Library for Python introduced many new routines to the library.  
This is a list of examples that makes use of the new functionality

* [Portfolio optimization using second-order cone programming (SOCP)](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/NAGPythonExamples/blob/master/local_optimisation/SOCP/portfolio_optimisation_using_socp.ipynb)
* [Robust linear programming in portfolio optimization using the NAG Library](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/NAGPythonExamples/blob/master/local_optimisation/SOCP/robust_lp.ipynb)
* [Nearest Correlation Matrix Comparison](https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/NAGPythonExamples/blob/master/neareast_correlation_matrices/ncm_poster.ipynb)  The notebook behind [this poster](https://www.nag.com/market/posters/nearest-correlation-algos-nag-library.pdf)
