    "# Optimized multiplication of triangular matrices with the NAG Library for Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the NAG blog post [Exploting Matrix Structure in the solution of linear systems](https://www.nag.com/content/exploiting-matrix-structure-solution-linear-systems) there is a demonstation showing how paying attention to matrix structure can reap dividends in optimization of computation time.  Using specialised solvers at the right time can significantly speed up your computational workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One case that was of interest to one of our clients was matrix-matrix multiplication where **both** input matrices were triangular.  The standard BLAS specification has a routine called **dtrmm** (also implemented in the NAG Library for Python) which contains optimizations when **one** of the input matrices is triangular but there was nothing that took advantage of the situation where **both** input matrices are triangular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the new routines in Mark 27 of the NAG library considers the case of matrix-matrix multiplication when both input matrices are [upper or lower triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix) in structure. The two new routines, **real_tri_matmul_inplace** and **complex_tri_matmul_inplace** implement real and complex versions of this calculation respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We have attempted to make the new routines as 'BLAS-like' as possible so if you are used to using **dtrmm**, you'll have no problem using the new material. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we show how calling this routine from the [NAG Library for Python](https://www.nag.com/nag-library-python) can result in faster multiplications of large matrices compared to using the default matrix-matrix-multiplication or the more specialised **dtrmm** even when an optimized [BLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) such as the [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) is in use."
