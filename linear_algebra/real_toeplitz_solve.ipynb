    "In a [recent post on his personal blog](http://www.reidatcheson.com/fun/linear%20algebra/2019/02/27/linear-algebra-secrets.html), NAG employee Reid Atcheson mentioned that the fastest numerical linear algebra routines usually exploit some kind of matrix structure. Reid went on to discuss [Toeplitz matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix) in particular. Reid's post got me wondering, just how much of a difference can using specialised solvers make?\n",

    "In one of my talks, [High Performance Computing: There's plenty of Room at the Bottom](http://mikecroucher.github.io/RedOak/), I cite the paper [A survey of the practice of computational science](http://files.software-carpentry.org/training-course/2012/08/prabhu-survey-2011.pdf) by Prabhu et al who say \"Across disciplines, an order of magnitude performance improvement was cited as a requirement for significant changes in research quality.\"  So, ideally anything I do to speed things up will give us at least a factor of 10 improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, I made use of the [NAG library for Python](http://www.nag.com/nag-library-python) within a Jupyter notebook which is what you are looking at now. The original notebook is available in the linear algebra section of [NAG's Python Examples GitHub repo](http://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/NAGPythonExamples).\n",
