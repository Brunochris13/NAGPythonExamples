# First-order Active-set method

FOAS is [first-order method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_method) 
for large-scale [non-linear programming (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming) 
with bound-constraints. 
The nature of the method makes its ideal for solving very
large problems where only the first-order derivatives are necessary.

The following figure shows a 2D version of the Rosenbrock problem where the minimum is shown
as a yellow point.
